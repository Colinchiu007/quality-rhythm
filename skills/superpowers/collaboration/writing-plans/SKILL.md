# Writing Plans

## Overview

Write comprehensive implementation plans assuming the engineer has zero context for our codebase and questionable taste. Document everything they need to know: which files to touch for each task, code, testing, docs they might need to check, how to test it. Give them the whole plan as bite-sized tasks. DRY. YAGNI. TDD. Frequent commits.

Assume they are a skilled developer, but know almost nothing about our toolset or problem domain. Assume they don't know good test design very well.

**Announce at start:** "I'm using the Writing Plans skill to create the implementation plan."

**Context:** This should be run in a dedicated worktree (created by brainstorming skill).

**Save plans to:** `docs/plans/YYYY-MM-DD-<feature-name>.md`

## Bite-Sized Task Granularity

**Each step is one action (2-5 minutes):**
- "Write the failing test" - step
- "Run it to make sure it fails" - step
- "Implement the minimal code to make the test pass" - step
- "Run the tests and make sure they pass" - step
- "Commit" - step

## Plan Document Header

**Every plan MUST start with this header:**

```markdown
# [Feature Name] Implementation Plan

> **For Codex:** Use `${SUPERPOWERS_SKILLS_ROOT}/skills/collaboration/executing-plans/SKILL.md` to implement this plan task-by-task.

**Goal:** [One sentence describing what this builds]

**Architecture:** [2-3 sentences about approach]

**Tech Stack:** [Key technologies/libraries]

---
```

## Task Structure

```markdown
### Task N: [Component Name]

**Files:**
- Create: `exact/path/to/file.py`
- Modify: `exact/path/to/existing.py:123-145`
- Test: `tests/exact/path/to/test.py`

**Step 1: Write the failing test**

```python
def test_specific_behavior():
    result = function(input)
    assert result == expected
```

**Step 2: Run test to verify it fails**

Run: `pytest tests/path/test.py::test_name -v`
Expected: FAIL with "function not defined"

**Step 3: Write minimal implementation**

```python
def function(input):
    return expected
```

**Step 4: Run test to verify it passes**

Run: `pytest tests/path/test.py::test_name -v`
Expected: PASS

**Step 5: Commit**

```bash
git add tests/path/test.py src/path/file.py
git commit -m "feat: add specific feature"
```
```

## Remember
- Exact file paths always
- Complete code in plan (not "add validation")
- Exact commands with expected output
- Reference relevant skills with @ syntax
- DRY, YAGNI, TDD, frequent commits


## Required Stages Per Task

Every task in the plan MUST include these three stages.
This is not optional — a plan without test/doc/review is an incomplete plan.

### Required task template

```
### Task N: [short name]

**Implementation:**
- Files to change: [paths]
- What to change: [description]

**Testing:**
- [ ] Unit test for normal path
- [ ] Unit test for error/edge case
- [ ] Integration test (if multi-module)

**Documentation:**
- [ ] Update API docs (if interface changes)
- [ ] Update README (if user-facing feature)
- [ ] Update architecture docs (if structural change)

**Review:**
- [ ] Self-review: diff quality check
- [ ] Cross-review: ask another agent/teammate (if >100 lines)
```

### Stage reduction rules

Some tasks may legitimately skip stages, but the default is "all stages":

- **Test stage reduction:** Allowed only for pure refactoring with 100% existing coverage
- **Doc stage reduction:** Allowed only for internal-only changes with no interface impact
- **Review stage reduction:** Allowed only for 1-file, <20 line changes

When reducing, explicitly note the reason in the plan.

## Execution Handoff

After saving the plan, offer execution choice:

**"Plan complete and saved to `docs/plans/<filename>.md`. Two execution options:**

**1. Subagent-Driven (this session)** - I dispatch fresh subagent per task, review between tasks, fast iteration

**2. Parallel Session (separate)** - Open new session with executing-plans, batch execution with checkpoints

**Which approach?"**

**If Subagent-Driven chosen:**
- Use skills/collaboration/subagent-driven-development
- Stay in this session
- Fresh subagent per task + code review

**If Parallel Session chosen:**
- Guide them to open new session in worktree
- New session uses skills/collaboration/executing-plans
